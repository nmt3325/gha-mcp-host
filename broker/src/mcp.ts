 * point of this project is that the model gets a readable, actionable result
 * instead of `MCP error -32001: Request timed out`.
 *
 * The payload is emitted twice on purpose: as `structuredContent` for callers
 * that can consume it, and as compact JSON text for callers that only read
 * `content`. Notion's client is in the second group today.
 *
 * NOTE ON outputSchema: not declared yet, deliberately. Declaring it would
 * make the SDK validate `structuredContent` before it leaves the server, which
 * is what we want -- but `ok()` and `fail()` return different key sets today,
 * so a single schema would have to be a union loose enough to validate nothing
 * useful. The fix is to give every tool one key set with every field always
 * present (the invariant exec/exec_read already follow) and then declare an
 * exact schema. That refactor plus outputSchema is M2; the zod major is no
 * longer an open question, since the build resolves zod 4.
