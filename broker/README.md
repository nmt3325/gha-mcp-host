# gha-mcp-broker

A Cloudflare Worker that lets an AI client open a real Linux, macOS or Windows
shell on a GitHub Actions runner and drive it over MCP.

The runner half lives at the [repository root](../README.md) of
`fmdntracker/gha-mcp-host`. This directory contains the broker: it dispatches the
workflow, holds the lease, and is the only thing the MCP client talks to.

For an existing deployment, read [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) first. This code
move does not itself deploy a Worker, rotate secrets or change the production
build source.

```

                          EnvDO (one per environment)  <--long poll--  runner agent
                          GuardDO (rate limit, breaker)
```

## The constraint everything is shaped by

An MCP request is cancelled after **60 seconds** by default. Anything slower
comes back to the caller as `MCP error -32001: Request timed out`, and a build,
a test run or an `npm install` is routinely slower than that.

So no tool here waits for a command to finish. `execute` starts the command,
waits up to `wait_ms` (30s by default), returns whatever output exists by then,
and hands back a `job_id` with a byte offset. `poll_job` resumes from that
offset. Output is addressed **by absolute byte range**, like HTTP Range, with no
server-side cursor anywhere:

- Re-reading the same `{from_byte, max_bytes}` returns the same bytes. A client
  that just lost a response to a timeout can simply ask again.
- Two readers cannot interfere with each other, because neither of them moves
  anything.
- A command that outlives the client, the isolate, or both is still readable
  afterwards from wherever the reader left off.

When the client sends a `progressToken`, the server also emits
`notifications/progress` every 5 seconds while a tool is working, which lets a
client that opted into `resetTimeoutOnProgress` wait longer than 60s. It is
treated as a bonus, never as a requirement.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `env_create` | Dispatch a runner for one platform, return an `env_id` |
| `env_status` | State, TTL, disk, queue depth, recent commands, runner facts |
| `env_list` | Every live environment this broker knows about |
| `env_extend` | Push the lease out, up to the hard cap from creation |
| `env_destroy` | Cancel the run and release the environment |
| `execute` | Run an argv command, wait up to `wait_ms`, return the first window of output |
| `start_command` | Start an argv command in the background, return a `job_id` at once |
| `poll_job` | Read any byte range of a job's output, optionally waiting for exit |
| `stop_job` | Stop one job, or all of them, with the whole process tree |
| `without_sandbox` | Alias of `execute`; nothing here is sandboxed to begin with |
| `read_file` | Read a UTF-8 text file, with a `base_sha` for conditional writes |
| `write_file` | Replace a text file atomically and report a unified diff |
| `list_directory` | One directory, sorted, with directories marked by a trailing `/` |
| `get_image` | Return an image, or a generic embedded file for clients with a cached tool catalog |
| `get_file` | Return any file up to 5 MiB as a native MCP embedded resource |

Every `execute`, `start_command` and `poll_job` result has the **same key set**,
always, with every
field present -- `state`, `exit_code`, `text`, `start_byte`, `next_byte`, `eof`,
`killed_reason`, `poll_error` and the rest. A field that appears only in the
interesting case forces the caller to branch on key existence, and a caller that
guesses wrong reports `state: unknown` instead of what actually happened.

Run multiple environments at once and address each one by its `env_id`:
`linux-xxxxxxxx`, `mac-xxxxxxxx`, `win-xxxxxxxx`.

| `src/kill-reason.ts` | Why a command died, and which reason wins |
| `src/bytes.ts` | Base64, ANSI stripping, the single output cut site |

### Where output actually lives

The runner appends everything to a single `out.raw` file and never deletes it,
so for as long as the environment lives, the runner can re-serve any byte range
on demand. The broker keeps a 512 KiB in-memory ring in front of that, and when
a command reaches a terminal state it persists the last 32 KiB together with the
exit code -- because a finished command's exit code must not outlive the output
that explains it.

ANSI stripping, UTF-8 boundary repair and the partial-line hold happen **exactly
once**, at broker read time. Two cut sites would mean the same byte range could
answer differently on a re-read, and re-reading is the entire recovery story.

## Setup

Run broker commands from this directory (not from the repository root):

```bash
cd broker  # from the repository root
npx --yes npm@11.19.1 install --no-audit --no-fund --package-lock=false
npm run typecheck
npx vitest run --passWithNoTests
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir dist
```

npm 11.19.1 is used to avoid the observed Node 22 bundled npm 10.9.8 peer-resolver
`edgesOut` crash. There is no committed lockfile yet, so these workflows use
`npm install`, not `npm ci`. The Vitest suite covers `src/argv.ts` (including a
round trip through a real `bash`) and `src/diff.ts`; the byte-window and tool
layers are still only exercised by `test/e2e.sh` against a mock runner.

Worker secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_PAT_DISPATCH   # repo scope on the runner repo
npx wrangler secret put BROKER_SECRET         # shared with the runner repo
npx wrangler secret put MCP_AUTH_TOKEN        # bearer token your MCP client sends
```

Runner repository secrets: `BROKER_URL` (this Worker's URL) and `BROKER_SECRET`
(the same value).

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Then add `https://<your-worker>/mcp` as an MCP server with an
`Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>` header.

`wrangler.toml` vars worth knowing: `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_REF`,
`DEFAULT_TTL_MINUTES`, `MAX_TTL_MINUTES`, `MAX_ENV_CREATES_PER_HOUR`,
`MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES`, `EXEC_WORKERS`, `AGENT_WAIT_SECONDS`.

Other routes: `GET /healthz`, and `GET /probe?wait=N` which holds a response
open for N seconds so you can measure how long a GET actually survives from
inside each runner OS before something in the middle cuts it.

## What this deliberately does not do

**No command allow list or deny list.** A shell on a machine holding a token
with repository write access cannot be made safe by pattern matching the command
string; a list long enough to matter is a list long enough to break real work,
and every version of it is bypassable in one line of shell. The real controls
are the ones that hold regardless of what runs: a short lease, a disposable
runner, a create-rate limit, and a token scoped to one repository. See
`src/config.ts`.

**No sandbox around the command.** local-mcp confines a command with Landlock on
Linux and Seatbelt on macOS. This broker does not, because the unit of isolation
is one level up: an environment IS a throwaway runner that holds nothing of ours
and is destroyed with the job. A second, weaker boundary inside it would buy no
safety and would mostly produce commands that fail for reasons the caller cannot
see. `without_sandbox` exists only so a client written against local-mcp finds
the tool it expects; it is the same handler as `execute`.

**No separate stdout and stderr.** The runner hands the child one appending file
descriptor for both, which is what removes the pipe deadlock this design exists
to avoid. Nothing downstream can tell them apart again, so `output` is the
interleaved stream as the command wrote it.

**No reattach-to-a-live-stream protocol.** Every design that keeps a mutable
read position on the server breaks the moment a request is cancelled at 60
seconds, because the client cannot tell whether the read it lost had already
moved the cursor.

## Status

Commands, text files, images and downloadable files up to 5 MiB are covered. Still open: `outputSchema` declarations,
disk reclaim, and `file_edit`-style exact-string editing -- the runner keeps its
`edit` op, but no tool is wired to it, so an edit is a `read_file` plus a
`write_file` today.
